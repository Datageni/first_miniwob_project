## MiniWoB First Project

The MiniWoB++ library contains a collection of over 100 web interaction environments, along with JavaScript and Python interfaces for programmatically interacting with them. The Python interface follows the Gymnasium API and uses Selenium WebDriver to perform actions on the web browser.

In this GitHub repository, we will be creating our first MiniWoB++ Reinforcement Learning Model in the most basic environment: _click-test-2_. In this environment, our model will learn to click on the DOM element whose text is equal to "ONE" in less than 10 seconds to receive a positive reward.
